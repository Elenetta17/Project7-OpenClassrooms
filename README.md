# Project7-OpenClassrooms
Implement a scoring model

## Business case
The company "Prêt à dépenser" offers consumer credit for people with little or no loan history.

The company wants to implement a “credit scoring” tool to calculate the probability that a customer will repay his credit, then classify the request as granted or refused credit. The company thus wishes to develop a classification algorithm based on various data sources (behavioral data, data from other financial institutions, etc.).

The data used for this project is available on Kaggle at https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/home-credit-default-risk

NB: A first preprocessing was done using the Kaggle kernel available at https://www.kaggle.com/code/jsaguiar/lightgbm-with-simple-features/script
